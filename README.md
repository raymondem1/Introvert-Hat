So I absolutely despise people coming up to talk to me... it's the worst. So I made a hat that has GLaDOS say the phrase "Warning social interaction ahead" whenever it sees a person... genius. 



The hat runs on the YOLOv5 framework and that does most of the heavy lifting. All I added really was the code for the hat to react to people specifically. The two files that you should look for are the detecthat2.py and the detect.py.
